My return to React/Redux. 
Here are some theories that possibly explain what is occuring in redux background and how it relates to components' state and the use of 'this'.

event emitter is cool for custom events otherwise use something else.

class C extends EventEmitter //from nodejs library
m(){this.emit("eventN") }
when called,
m.on("eventN", ()=> {} );

The syntax for (html onEventAttrib, js .onEventMethods(), js .addEventListener() ) https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp
1) <element onclick="myScript()"> <script>function myFunction() {} </script>
2) node.onclick = function(){myScript()};
3) node.addEventListener("click", myScript);

* He shows how it should be done. (to me is at its simplest form)
* JSX; where myscript is defined in a class.
  if he didn't bind (this.myScript) than 'this' would be undefined and not refering to the class.
  <element onClick={ this.myScript().bind(this) }> <script>function myFunction() {} </script>
* same as. Reason = arrow function auto-binds this.
  <element onClick={ () => this.myScript() }> <script>function myFunction() {} </script>

This is what my theory is about and relating to portion above.
The Redux Way with its bindActionCreators()  = https://youtu.be/_x3gitcwtAc
in component,
matchDispatchToProps(dispatch){
  return bindActionCreators( {mathN: actionCreatorN}, dispatch );
} 

The Theory
Based on CS50's way with only react you relize that binding is necessary 
and then have some of the questions mentioned below regarding decoupling functions from a file and that passing them through props instead of import and strait call and possiblie this issues.
**The theory is that 'matchDispatchToProps' is a redux method that binds functions to props for you and handlilng the 'this' aspect**.

Academind #2 what/why redux = https://youtu.be/D2MqT4OEgoE
Why redux?
to help not need handle passing info of component state updates to other components
thus, 1 sotre to store all components' state and be aware of other components' states.

Questions
need to create new instanace?
^this is a prob in itself?
to decouple from file (the defining location )?
^this refers to in file/function, means can't export/import?
